Firedrake
#########

`Firedrake <https://firedrakeproject.org>`__ is a Python-based finite element
package which automatically generates C kernels and uses `PETSc <petsc.html>`__
to solve linear and nonlinear systems.

Whilst a PhD student and then postdoc at `Imperial College London
<https://imperial.ac.uk>`__, I make several contributions to Firedrake and
regularly attended the development meetings.

Major contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Enhancements to the automatic differentiation and adjoint modelling
  functionality.
* `Jupyter notebook
  <https://nbviewer.org/github/firedrakeproject/firedrake/blob/master/docs/notebooks/11-extract-adjoint-solutions.ipynb>`__
  on solving adjoint problems in Firedrake.
* `Documentation section
  <https://www.firedrakeproject.org/petsc-interface.html#accessing-the-petsc-mesh-representation>`__
  on accessing the PETSc mesh representation underlying the one used in
  Firedrake.
