Packages supporting mesh adaptation in Firedrake
================================================

Main contribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whilst a Research Associate at Imperial College London, I worked on advanced
discretisation techniques for finite element methods for coastal ocean
modelling. In particular, I sought to take the methods that I'd worked on in my
PhD thesis and make them available to the Firedrake user community. To this end,
I created three tools for implementing different types of mesh adaptation using
Firedrake's domain-specific language:

* `Animate <../animate.html>`__ - anisotropic metric-based mesh adaptation
  package, which builds on the `Mmg-PETSc coupling project <ecse-mmg.html>`__.
* `Movement <../movement.html>`__ - library of mesh movement methods.
* `Goalie <../goalie.html>`__ - framework for goal-oriented error estimation,
  supporting goal-oriented mesh adaptation using tools such as Animate and
  Movement.

The initial work was done as part of my postdoc at `Imperial College London
<https://www.imperial.ac.uk>`__, which was funded by an `ARCHER2 eCSE
<https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse>`__ grant from `EPCC
<https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk>`__.

The ongoing software development and maintenance of Animate, Goalie, and
Movement also received funding from `Huawei Corporation Ltd.
<https://www.huawei.com/en>`__ as part of collaboration with the Noah's Ark Lab.
