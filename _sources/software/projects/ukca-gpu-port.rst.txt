UKCA GPU port
=============

Whilst a Scientific Software Engineer (SSE) at the Met Office, I was deployed
on the GPU port for UKCA. UKCA is known to be a particularly computationally
costly part of the Met Office's model, making it a key candidate for
acceleration via GPU offloading.

Early in the project, I worked with collaborators to first manually insert
`OpenACC <https://www.openacc.org>`__ pragmas for offloading on Nvidia GPUs.
Facilitating this also involved major code changes and refactoring.

Later in the project, I led the effort to replicate the manual insertion of
OpenACC pragmas using PSyclone, to improve portability of the GPU porting
approach. To achieve this, I developed an internal tool for streamlining OpenACC
GPU porting with PSyclone, which I have since upstreamed into PSyclone itself.

Upon joining the University of Cambridge as an RSE, I was deployed part-time
onto the follow-up project, NG-ARCH, which was outsourced to several UK
universities by the Met Office. The focus of this work is to build upon the
ExCALIBUR effort and work to get the approach merged into the main codebase.

I continue to make regular contributions to both UKCA and PSyclone.

My work as an SSE at the Met Office received funding from the UK's `ExCALIBUR
<https://excalibur.ac.uk>`__ exascale computing grant. The NG-ARCH project is
part of the Met Office's `Next-Generation Modelling Systems (NGMS)
<https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/next-gen-modelling-systems>`__
programme.
