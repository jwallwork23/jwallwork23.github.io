Coupling mesh adaptation tools Mmg and ParMmg to PETSc and Firedrake
====================================================================

I led the effort to integrate the `Mmg and ParMmg <https://www.mmgtools.org>`__
metric-based mesh adaptation tools into the numerical solver library `PETSc
<../petsc.html>`__, and subsequently making this functionality available in the
`Firedrake <../firedrake.html>`__ finite element library.

Mmg, ParMmg, and PETSc are all written in C. Firedrake is a Python-based
package which automatically generates C kernels and uses PETSc to solve linear
and nonlinear systems.
