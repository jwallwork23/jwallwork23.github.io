Data-driven mesh adaptation
===========================

Main contribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I am involved in a research project base at `Imperial College London
<https://www.imperial.ac.uk>`__ on various advanced topics related to mesh
adaptation as a consultant.

In the first half on data-driven methods, we investigated how mesh movement
methods such as those implemented in `Movement <../movement.html>`__ might be
swapped out for machine learning (ML) approaches, to accelerate the mesh
adaptation process and overcome certain limitation associated with classical
mesh movement methods.

In :cite:`ZK24`, we established an approach termed UM2N ('Universal Mesh
Movement Networks'). When a classical mesh movement method was swapped out for
UM2N, the computational cost was reduced by several orders of magnitude, since
we were able to avoid expensive auxiliary PDE solves, such as Monge-Ampère type
equations. Moreover, we found that UM2N was able to overcome the limitation of
Monge-Ampère type methods being restricted to convex domains. The 'universal'
part of the acronym refers to the fact that the data-driven approach can be
trained once and then deployed for any (physical) PDE - a great advantage over
other approaches, such as our previous work in :cite:`SZ22`, in which the ML
model is trained per physical PDE.
