Combining mesh adaptation and PDE-constrained optimisation
==========================================================


Main contribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I am involved in a research project base at `Imperial College London
<https://www.imperial.ac.uk>`__ on various advanced topics related to mesh
adaptation as a consultant.

In the second half of the project, we are investigating how mesh adaptation
approaches may be combined into PDE-constrained optimisation methods such that
they accelerate the convergence and/or time-to-solution of the optimisation
approaches. As part of this work, I am in the process of adding PDE-constrained
optimisation functionality to `Goalie <../goalie.html>`__, so that we will be
able to interleave goal-oriented mesh adaptation with the optimisation process.
