GISS-GC
=======

Coupling effort for the `GISS Model E
<https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/coupled-products/modelIE>`__
weather and climate model with the `GEOS-Chem
<https://geoschem.github.io/index.html>`__ atmospheric chemistry model. Both
models are written in Fortran.

Project GitHub repo: https://github.com/fetch4/GISS-GC.

Main contribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I led ICCS' effort to complete the coupling effort initiated in `GCAP 2.0
<https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/5789/2021/>`__. This involved project
management, as well as the technical tasks of configuring, building and running
the coupled model on different high-performance computers, setting up
development tools for the project, and ensuring that restart files and
diagnostics are handled correctly.

As part of this project, I had a contribution included in `GEOS-Chem version
14.5.1 <https://zenodo.org/records/14629792>`__ and have an upcoming
contribution to version 14.6.0.
