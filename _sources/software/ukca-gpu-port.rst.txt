UKCA GPU port
=============

The `United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols (UKCA)
<https://www.ukca.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/UKCA>`__ model is the UK's community
atmospheric chemistry model. It is written in Fortran and has been developed by
contributors from several research groups and institutions (notably the Met
Office, University of Cambridge, and University of Leeds) over several decades.
It is a core part of the Met Office's operational weather model and the
`United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM) <https://ukesm.ac.uk/>`__, which has
contributed to `Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP)
<https://wcrp-cmip.org>`__ climate modelling iterations, whose data support
`IPCC <https://www.ipcc.ch>`__ reports.

`PSyclone <https://github.com/stfc/psyclone>`__ is a Python-based
domain-specific compiler and code transformation system for Earth-system models
written in Fortran. It plays a key role in the Met Office's next-generation
weather model `LFRic
<https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/lfric>`__ and
can be used to transform code according to user-provided transformation
specifications.

Main contribution 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whilst a Scientific Software Engineer (SSE) at the Met Office, I was deployed
on the GPU port for UKCA. UKCA is known to be a particularly computationally
costly part of the Met Office's model, making it a key candidate for
acceleration via GPU offloading.

Early in the project, I worked with collaborators to first manually insert
`OpenACC <https://www.openacc.org>`__ pragmas for offloading on Nvidia GPUs.
Facilitating this also involved major code changes and refactoring.

Later in the project, I led the effort to replicate the manual insertion of
OpenACC pragmas using PSyclone, to improve portability of the GPU porting
approach. To achieve this, I developed an internal tool for streamlining OpenACC
GPU porting with PSyclone, which I have since upstreamed into PSyclone itself.

My work as an SSE at the Met Office received funding from the UK's `ExCALIBUR
<https://excalibur.ac.uk>`__ exascale computing grant.

Main contribution 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon joining the University of Cambridge as an RSE, I was deployed part-time
onto the follow-up project, NG-ARCH, which was outsourced to several UK
universities by the Met Office. The focus of this work is to build upon the
ExCALIBUR effort and work to get the approach merged into the main codebase.

I continue to make regular contributions to both UKCA and PSyclone.

The NG-ARCH project is part of the Met Office's

programme.
