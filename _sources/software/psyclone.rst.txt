`PSyclone <https://github.com/stfc/psyclone>`__ is a Python-based
domain-specific compiler and code transformation system for Earth-system models
written in Fortran. It plays a key role in the Met Office's next-generation
weather model `LFRic

can be used to transform code according to user-provided transformation
specifications.
