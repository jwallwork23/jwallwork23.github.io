PETSc
=====

`PETSc <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc>`__ is a numerical solver library written
in C.

I made several contributions to PETSc whilst a PhD student and then postdoc at
`Imperial College London <https://imperial.ac.uk>`__. I also worked on PETSc
for several months while interning `Argonne National Laboratory
<https://www.anl.gov>`__.

Major contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Integrated the `Mmg and ParMmg <https://www.mmgtools.org>`__ metric-based
  mesh adaptation tools into PETSc.
* Integrated the `ADOL-C <https://github.com/coin-or/ADOL-C>`__ automatic
  differentiation tool into PETSc.
