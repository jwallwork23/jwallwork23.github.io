FTorch is a library for coupling PyTorch models to Fortran. This is done by
interfacing Fortran with the `libtorch` C++ backend underlying PyTorch, via the
`iso_c_binding` module, which has been intrinsic to Fortran since the 2003
standard. It's an interesting project to work on, as it involves working with
code in Python, C, C++, and Fortran, amongst other languages, software
frameworks, and tools used for testing, linting, scripting, and documentation.

Major contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I have been a core developer of FTorch since joining ICCS. Some major
contributions of mine include:

* Enabling running on multiple GPU devices.
* Setting up and writing unit tests using the `pFUnit
  <https://github.com/Goddard-Fortran-Ecosystem/pFUnit>`__ unit test framework.

Project as Co-PI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Online training of large-scale Fortran-based hybrid computational science
models, with applications in climate science*

Co-PI with `Jack Atkinson <https://jackatkinson.net>`__.

Development tasks
"""""""""""""""""

* Set up online training in FTorch.
* Expose PyTorch's Autograd functionality in FTorch, meaning gradient values can
  be tracked across mathematical operations acting on Torch Tensors.

Community tasks
"""""""""""""""

* Organise and run a `workshop
  <https://cambridge-iccs.github.io/ml-coupling-workshop>`__ on best practices
  for integrating machine learning into large-scale scientific modelling
  frameworks.
* Research visits to assist collaborators with integrating online training into
  their ML workflows.
* Integrate FTorch into the `Community Earth System Model (CESM)
  <https://www.cesm.ucar.edu>`__ build system on
  the high-performance computing system at the `National Center for Atmospheric
  Research (NCAR) <https://ncar.ucar.edu>`__.
* Give FTorch tutorials on several occasions, including at `Durham HPC Days
  2025 <https://durham.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hpcdays/index.html>`_.

Project information
"""""""""""""""""""

This work was done as an RSE at the
`Institute of Computing for Climate Science (ICCS) <https://iccs.cam.ac.uk>`__.
It was supported by both ICCS and by a `joint grant
<https://www.c2d3.cam.ac.uk/opportunities/accelerate-programme-c2d3-2024-joint-funding-call>`__
from the `Cambridge Centre for Data-Driven Discovery (C2D3)
<https://www.c2d3.cam.ac.uk>`__ and `ai@cam <https://ai.cam.ac.uk>`__'s
`Accelerate Programme <https://science.ai.cam.ac.uk>`__.
