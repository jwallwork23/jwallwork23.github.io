FTorch
======

`FTorch <https://cambridge-iccs.github.io/FTorch>`__ is a library for coupling
PyTorch models to Fortran. This is done by interfacing Fortran with the
`libtorch` C++ backend underlying PyTorch, via the `iso_c_binding` module, which
has been intrinsic to Fortran since the 2003 standard. It's an interesting
project to work on, as it involves working with code in Python, C, C++, and
Fortran, amongst other languages, software frameworks, and tools used for
testing, linting, scripting, and documentation.

I have been a core developer of FTorch since joining the `Institute of
Computing for Climate Science (ICCS) <https://iccs.cam.ac.uk>`__.
