The `United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols (UKCA)
<https://www.ukca.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/UKCA>`__ model is the UK's community
atmospheric chemistry model. It is written in Fortran and has been developed by
contributors from several research groups and institutions (notably the Met
Office, University of Cambridge, and University of Leeds) over several decades.
It is a core part of the Met Office's operational weather model and the
`United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM) <https://ukesm.ac.uk/>`__, which has
contributed to `Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP)
<https://wcrp-cmip.org>`__ climate modelling iterations, whose data support
`IPCC <https://www.ipcc.ch>`__ reports.

Major contributions
"""""""""""""""""""

* Add functionality to pass the whole domain's worth of data to the chemistry
  solver, as opposed to vertical columns or horizontal slices.
* Allow the code base to be parsable by `PSyclone <psyclone.html>`__.
